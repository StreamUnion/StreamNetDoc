TRIAS StreamNet is a new design based on the existing mature DAG system. It is prone to double-flowering and replay attacks against existing systems, and the transaction speed is slow. The introduction of Coordinator leads to the centralization assumption. Based on the flow chart calculation in the graph calculation, a new DAG platform is designed that comprehensively considers transaction information (points), transaction approval information (edges), and network structure (such as Katz Centrality).
